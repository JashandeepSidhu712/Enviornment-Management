# WHAT IS ACID RAIN
Acid rain refers to **precipitation**, such as rain, snow, sleet, or fog, that **contains elevated levels of acidic compounds**, primarily 
1. sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and
2. nitric acid (HNO3).

These acids are formed when **pollutants released into the atmosphere undergo chemical reactions with water vapor**, <br>
creating acidic compounds that subsequently fall to the Earth's surface in precipitation.

# CAUSES OF ACID RAIN
The primary causes of acid rain are the **release of** 
1. sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
2. nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere from human activities,
primarily the
1. burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil for energy production, as well as
2. industrial processes and
3. vehicular emissions.

These pollutants can travel long distances in the atmosphere before combining with water vapor to form acidic compounds.

# GASES INVOLVED IN ACID RAIN
The two main gases involved in acid rain formation are sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). 

SO2 is produced mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels containing sulfur compounds, 

while NOx is generated from combustion processes, especially in vehicles and power plants.

# HOW ACID RAIN OCCURS
Acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere from various sources, including industrial facilities, vehicles, and power plants. 

Once in the atmosphere, these **pollutants react with atmospheric moisture**, 

forming sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). 

These acids are carried by air currents, forming acidic clouds or precipitation when they encounter water droplets.

# FORMS OF ACID DEPOSITION
Acid deposition can take several forms, including:

## Wet Deposition
This is the most common form and includes 
1. acid rain,
2. acid snow,
3. acid fog, and
4. acid sleet.

These forms involve acidic compounds dissolving in precipitation and falling to the Earth's surface.

## Dry Deposition
In this form, acidic pollutants in the atmosphere can **settle directly onto surfaces**, including buildings, vegetation, and bodies of water, 

without undergoing wet precipitation. 

This can occur through the deposition of dry particles and aerosols containing acid-forming compounds.

# EFFECTS OF ACID RAIN
The effects of acid rain can be widespread and harmful:

### Environmental Impact
Acid rain can damage forests, lakes, rivers, and aquatic ecosystems by leaching essential nutrients from the soil and water, affecting the health of plants and aquatic life.

### Infrastructure Damage
Buildings, statues, and cultural heritage sites made of limestone, marble, or other susceptible materials can deteriorate due to exposure to acid rain.

### Human Health Concerns
While direct exposure to acid rain is generally not harmful to human health, the pollutants that cause acid rain, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), can contribute to the formation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which poses respiratory and cardiovascular health risks.

# ACIDIC RANGE
The acidity of rain and other forms of acid deposition is measured on the pH scale, with a pH of 7 being neutral, lower values indicating acidity, and higher values indicating alkalinity. Acid rain typically has a pH range of 4.0 to 4.4, making it more acidic than pure rainwater, which has a pH around 5.6 due to natural carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
