# What is Global Warming?
Global warming is the **long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature** due to the buildup of certain gases in the atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases. 

These gases, including 
1. carbon dioxide (CO2),
2. methane (CH4),
3. nitrous oxide (N2O), and others, trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping into space.

This leads to a warming effect on the planet's climate, with various environmental and societal consequences.

# Is Global Warming Required or Beneficial in a Certain Amount?
Global warming, as it is occurring today, is not required or beneficial in the current context. 

Current rate of warming is far from natural and poses risks to ecosystems. 

While a certain amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is necessary to maintain temperatures suitable for life, the current excess of these gases is causing detrimental effects.

# How is Global Warming Harmful?
Global warming has several harmful consequences:

### Rising Sea Levels
**Melting ice caps and glaciers**, combined with the thermal expansion of seawater, lead to rising sea levels, threatening coastal areas and low-lying islands.

### Extreme Weather Events
**Increased temperatures contribute to more frequent and severe weather events**, including hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires.

### Ecosystem Disruption
Global warming disrupts ecosystems, impacting **plant and animal species**, flura and fauna, their migration patterns, and the balance of food chains.

### Food Security Threats
Changing climate conditions can harm agriculture, causing reduced crop yields and food shortages in some regions.

### Health Risks
**Heatwaves, changing disease patterns, and increased air pollution** pose health risks to humans, including heat-related illnesses and the spread of certain diseases.

# Causes of Global Warming
The primary causes of global warming are human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere:

### Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy production and transportation <br>
Deforestation and land-use changes also contribute.

### Methane (CH4)
agricultural practices (such as rice cultivation and livestock), <br>
landfills, and the production and <br>
transport of fossil fuels (especially natural gas and oil).

### Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
Agricultural and industrial activities, <br>
as well as the combustion of fossil fuels

### Fluorinated Gases
refrigeration, <br>
air conditioning, and <br>
electronics manufacturing,

# How Can We Prevent Global Warming?
Preventing global warming and mitigating its impacts require collective efforts and significant changes in human behavior and policies. Key strategies include:

### Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The most critical step is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. This can be achieved by 
1. transitioning to cleaner energy sources (renewables),
2. improving energy efficiency, and
3. adopting sustainable practices in agriculture, transportation, and industry.

### Afforestation and Reforestation
Planting trees and preserving forests help sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing its concentration.

### Transition to Sustainable Agriculture
Implementing sustainable agricultural practices can reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions.

### International Cooperation
Global efforts, such as the **Paris Agreement**, aim to coordinate actions among countries to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
