# CLEAN DEVELOPEMENT MECHANISAM CDM
The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a component of the **Kyoto Protocol**, an international treaty **aimed at addressing global climate change**. 

The CDM was established to **promote sustainable development in developing countries** while **helping developed countries meet their targets for reducing their emissions** known as emission reduction targets.

The Kyoto Protocol recognizes the historical responsibility of developed countries for the majority of past greenhouse gas emissions.

Developed countries have an incentive to participate in the CDM because it allows them to earn Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits for emission reductions achieved through projects in developing countries.

# Aims of CDM:

Allow developed countries to invest in projects in developing countries that reduce emissions.

Promote sustainable development in host countries by sharing clean technologies and creating opportunities.

# Incentives Offered:

Developed countries participate because CDM allows them to earn credits called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) for emission reductions achieved through projects in developing countries.

CERs help developed countries meet their emission reduction targets cost-effectively.

# CARBON CREDITS

Carbon credits are like certificates that represent a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, typically measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). 

Each CER is for one metric ton of emissions reduced.

These credits are earned when an entity, such as a company or a project, reduces its emissions below a certain baseline or target. 

Carbon credits can be bought, sold, or traded on carbon markets.

o earn carbon credits, an entity must reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4), compared to a predetermined baseline.

# CARBON CREDIT EXCHANGE

Carbon credit exchange is a marketplace where carbon credits (Certified Emission Reductions or CERs) are bought and sold. 

Entities with excess credits can sell them to those needing to offset their emissions. 

This exchange facilitates cost-effective compliance with emissions targets, supports emission reduction projects, and encourages climate action. 

Prices for carbon credits can fluctuate based on supply and demand and the urgency to reduce emissions. Overall, it's a key mechanism for global efforts to combat climate change.
